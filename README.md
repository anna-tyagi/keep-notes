# Daily Notes

Keep your daily notes in an organised way and use them whenever required. This webapp helps you to store the notes topicwise and by dates. It allows you to store images, code snippet and rich text all in one place making it quite user friendly.
## Running the webapp in local

For local setup, forllow the steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
3. Put the file containing the secrets with the name `.env` in the root folder.
4. Start the server by running the command `npm start`.

## For production build

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

## Other

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
